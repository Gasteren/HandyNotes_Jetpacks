# HandyNotes: Jetpacks

> 🚨 **Reminder:** This addon is a plugin for [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes). You **must** have HandyNotes installed for this to work.

## 🧭 Introduction

Welcome to my latest addon — **HandyNotes_Jetpacks**!

This addon displays all the **potential spawn points** where jetpacks can be built and obtained in the game.  
⚠️ **Note:** It only shows *locations*. It does **not** indicate whether a jetpack is currently available — there's no way to detect that (yet).

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the addon.
2. If you're not using an addon manager, place it in your `Interface/AddOns` folder manually.
3. Log in to World of Warcraft.
4. You're good to go!

Thanks for checking out the addon — and enjoy soaring through Mechagon!
